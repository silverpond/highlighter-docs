Currently this is not possible, but it is on our roadmap. If you have data soverignty requirements, we can assist by setting up an enterprise deployment of Highlighter in your data centre to meet those requirements. Please [contact our team](mailto:support@highlighter.ai) to arrange a conversation for more information.

## Agents and Capabilities

Agents are workers in Highlighter that have specific capabilities to perform assessments. Please see our [Agents concepts page](../concepts/agents/) learn more about what agents and capabilities are and how they work.

#### Can I train my own model?

Yes, you can train your own model. These models become an agent's capabilities in Highlighter. You can train the model inside of Highlighter using Highlighter's capabilities, or you can train the model outside of Highlighter and upload the model artefact to Highlighter to be run and managed inside Highlighter.

#### I want to run my own agents, is that possible?

Yes, we have designed the system which runs agents to be capable of running outside of our Highlighter Cloud. This means that you could host and run your own agents and have them submit their work to Highlighter.
