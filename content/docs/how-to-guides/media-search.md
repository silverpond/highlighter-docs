## Navigating to the media search page

Navigate to the media search page by clicking 'Develop' in the top nav then clicking 'Media' => 'Search' in the side nav.

## Anatomy

Firstly you will see a summary of how many files you are currently seeing.

To advance to the next page of results, use the pagination nav in the top right to select a page of results, Next/Prev, or First/Last.

## Filters

On the left of the page are filters that let you to look at your files in different ways. Set your desired filters then click the 'Search' button at the bottom to see files matching those filters.
