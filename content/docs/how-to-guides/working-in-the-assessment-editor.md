## Use Assessment Editor tools

The assessment editor tools are laid out across in the top toolbar.

### Use The Pointer Tool
The most commonly used tool is the pointer tool (shortcut key: 'q'). This tool is used to move the canvas around.

### Use The Annotation Tools
The annotation tools are grouped into a dropdown. The first one is the Bounding Box Annotation tool (shortcut key: 'w'), allowing you to draw rectangles. Click once to start, move your mouse until you see the rectangle you want, then click again to stop.

The second tool is the Polygon Annotation Tool (shortcut key: 'e'). This allows you to draw polygons of any shape. Click once to start, then click again to set the next point, keep clicking to set more points, then hit enter to finish. The polygon will automatically join back to your first point.

The third tool is the Line Annotation Tool (shortcut key: 'y'). This allows you draw lines. Click once to start, then click again to finish your line.

Once you have selected a tool within this group, it remains on top of the dropdown group for easy access later.

### Zoom
All tools allow you to zoom in and out using the scroll wheel of your mouse. You can also click the magnifying glass tools with the plus and minus inside.

## Access The File List
Access the list of currently loaded files in your case by clicking the little pull-out arrow at the left of the screen. Once open, click the little pull-in arrow to close again. This can also be toggled using shortcut key 'l'.

## Access the Objects Panel
Access the objects panel using the little pull-out arrow at the right of the screen. Once open, click the little pull-in arrow to close again.

## Set Annotation View Options
Set annotation view options by clicking the View menu in the top toolbar, then clicking 'Annotation'. You will see a menu of options which you can toggle on or off.

Set the visibility of each of these options individually:
- Fill - the coloured fill of the annotation
- Border - the border around the annotation
- Label - shows a summary of known annotation attributes
- Attributes - detailed listing of known annotation attributes

Options stay set even after reloading the page, or moving to new cases or data files.

## Show And Hide Annotations/Tracks
Show or hide all annotations/tracks (including associated text) by clicking the View menu, then "Show/hide annotations/tracks" (shortcut key 'f'). Hidden annotations/tracks are still submitted.

What is the difference between annotations and tracks? If you are working with images for example, you will work with annotations. However if you are working with video for example, annotations are grouped together into tracks, that stretch over time.

## Submit Assessments
Submit assessments by clicking the "Submit" button. Next to that button is a dropdown menu which has other options including "Skip" and "Flag and Submit".

### Skip
The skip option allows you to temporarily skip the current item/case. The assessment editor will load the next item, and then the next, and so on - you can continue working as normal through your assessment queue. You can even skip more items. When you want to get back your skipped items, just reload your browser window. Then all skipped items will appear again in the order you skipped them.

What is a case? A case is a collection of data files that will be assessed together. They can be of different media types, for example images, video, text and so on. You can see the list of data files in your case by choosing the View menu then "Show/hide left panel" (shortcut key 'l').

### Flag And Submit
This allows you to submit your assessments, and add in a short message. This message appears prominantly at various places around Highlighter, for example in the Media Search page. It allows you to signal something about this submission, for example that it contains an image that is too dark, and so on.
