When training an object detection model, you will often need to do some labelling first. This guide covers some of the features common to labelling for object detection.

## Navigate To The Assessment Editor

When you first log in to Highlighter, you should see your assessment dashboard. If not, click the 'Assess' link in the top navigation. Click the button in the main pane that says 'Start Task' or 'Continue Task'. This will take you to the Assessment Editor to start work. You will see this button if you have been assigned a work queue. If you don't see it, please contact your Highlighter project manager.
