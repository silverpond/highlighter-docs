## Overview

Human assessment stages involve manual review and processing by human experts. These stages are essential for tasks requiring human judgment, quality assurance, edge case handling, and training data creation.

## Creating Human Assessment Stages

### Prerequisites
- Defined review criteria and guidelines
- Trained reviewers with appropriate expertise
- Clear workflow requirements and expectations
- Access to workflow configuration tools

### Basic Setup

1. **Stage Configuration**
   - **Stage Name**: Descriptive name for the assessment stage
   - **Stage Type**: Select "Human Assessment"
   - **Review Type**: Classification, annotation, validation, or quality control
   - **Input Requirements**: Define data types and formats expected

2. **Reviewer Assignment**
   - **Reviewer Groups**: Assign specific groups or individuals
   - **Expertise Requirements**: Match reviewers to task complexity
   - **Workload Distribution**: Configure how tasks are distributed
   - **Backup Reviewers**: Assign secondary reviewers for coverage

3. **Review Parameters**
   - **Review Guidelines**: Detailed instructions for reviewers
   - **Quality Standards**: Define acceptable quality levels
   - **Time Limits**: Set reasonable completion timeframes
   - **Escalation Rules**: Handle complex or problematic cases

## Creating Human File Assessment Stages

### Stage Configuration
1. **File Processing Setup**
   - **File Types**: Specify supported file formats
   - **Batch Size**: Number of files per review session
   - **Priority Rules**: Determine file processing order
   - **Routing Logic**: Direct files to appropriate reviewers

2. **Review Interface**
   - **Annotation Tools**: Configure available labelling tools
   - **Review Templates**: Set up standardized review forms
   - **Decision Options**: Define possible review outcomes
   - **Comment System**: Enable reviewer feedback and notes

### Assigning to Inspectors

1. **Inspector Selection**
   - **Skill Matching**: Match inspectors to file types and complexity
   - **Workload Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across team
   - **Availability Management**: Consider inspector schedules and capacity
   - **Performance History**: Use past performance to guide assignments

2. **Assignment Methods**
   - **Manual Assignment**: Direct assignment by supervisors
   - **Automatic Distribution**: Algorithm-based assignment
   - **Self-Service**: Inspectors select from available work
   - **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of manual and automatic methods

## Using Human Assessment Stages

### Reviewer Workflow
1. **Task Access**
   - Log into the Highlighter platform
   - Navigate to assigned tasks queue
   - Select tasks based on priority and deadline
   - Begin review process following guidelines

2. **Review Process**
   - **Data Examination**: Thorough review of input data
   - **Annotation/Classification**: Apply labels or classifications
   - **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate data quality and completeness
   - **Decision Making**: Make required judgments or decisions

3. **Task Completion**
   - **Result Recording**: Document findings and decisions
   - **Quality Verification**: Double-check work for accuracy
   - **Submission**: Submit completed reviews
   - **Notes Documentation**: Add relevant comments or observations

### Quality Control
- **Peer Review**: Secondary review by another expert
- **Supervisor Approval**: Management review of critical decisions
- **Consensus Building**: Multiple reviewers for complex cases
- **Audit Trails**: Complete documentation of review decisions

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Stage Reviews
- **Sequential Review**: Multiple reviewers in sequence
- **Parallel Review**: Independent reviews compared for consensus
- **Hierarchical Review**: Junior reviewers supervised by senior experts
- **Specialized Stages**: Different experts for different aspects

### Workflow Integration
- **Conditional Routing**: Route based on review results
- **Machine-Human Hybrid**: Combine AI and human assessment
- **Feedback Loops**: Use human reviews to improve machine learning
- **Exception Handling**: Special processing for unusual cases

### Performance Management
- **Reviewer Metrics**: Track accuracy, speed, and consistency
- **Training Programs**: Ongoing education and skill development
- **Calibration Sessions**: Ensure consistency across reviewers
- **Performance Reviews**: Regular evaluation of reviewer performance
