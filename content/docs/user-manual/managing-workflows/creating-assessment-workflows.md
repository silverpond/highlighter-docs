## What is an Assessment Workflow?

An assessment workflow is a systematic sequence of evaluation stages that processes data through various assessment tasks. These workflows can combine human expertise, machine learning capabilities, and business rules to achieve comprehensive data evaluation and decision-making.

## Core Components

### Assessment Stages
Assessment workflows consist of multiple stages, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Data Intake**: Initial data validation and preprocessing
- **Machine Assessment**: Automated processing using AI agents
- **Human Review**: Expert evaluation and quality control
- **Decision Points**: Routing logic based on assessment results
- **Output Generation**: Final results and reporting

### Workflow Types

**Linear Workflows**
- Sequential processing through predefined stages
- Simple, predictable flow from start to finish
- Ideal for standardized assessment processes

**Branching Workflows**
- Conditional routing based on assessment results
- Multiple paths depending on data characteristics
- Flexible handling of different scenarios

**Parallel Workflows**
- Multiple assessment streams running simultaneously
- Independent evaluation by different experts or systems
- Consensus building through result aggregation

**Hybrid Workflows**
- Combination of machine and human assessment
- Machine processing with human oversight
- Escalation paths for complex or ambiguous cases

## Design Principles

### Clarity and Purpose
- **Clear Objectives**: Define what the workflow aims to achieve
- **Success Criteria**: Establish measurable outcomes
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all parties understand the purpose
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive workflow documentation

### Efficiency and Scalability
- **Resource Optimization**: Use appropriate mix of human and machine resources
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Design to avoid processing bottlenecks
- **Scalability Planning**: Consider future volume and complexity increases
- **Performance Monitoring**: Build in metrics and monitoring capabilities

### Quality and Consistency
- **Quality Gates**: Implement checkpoints to ensure quality standards
