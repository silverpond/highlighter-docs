## Overview

Machine assessment stages are automated workflow components that use trained AI agents to process data without human intervention. These stages can perform tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, and quality assessment at scale.

## Creating Machine Assessment Stages

### Prerequisites
- A trained AI agent or capability
- Access to workflow configuration
- Appropriate data sources and formats
- Defined success criteria and quality thresholds

### Basic Setup

1. **Stage Configuration**
   - **Stage Name**: Descriptive identifier for the assessment stage
   - **Stage Type**: Select "Machine Assessment"
   - **Input Requirements**: Define expected data formats and requirements
   - **Output Specifications**: Configure output format and destinations

2. **Agent Assignment**
   - **Select Agent**: Choose the trained AI agent for this stage
   - **Agent Version**: Specify which version to use
   - **Fallback Options**: Configure backup agents if primary fails
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Set up performance tracking

3. **Processing Parameters**
   - **Batch Size**: Number of items processed simultaneously
   - **Processing Timeout**: Maximum time allowed per item
   - **Resource Allocation**: CPU, GPU, and memory requirements
   - **Scaling Rules**: Auto-scaling based on workload

## Configuration Options

### Quality Thresholds
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum confidence levels for automated decisions
- **Quality Gates**: Criteria that must be met to proceed

   - **Task Name**: Clear identifier for the task
   - **Input Specification**: Define what data the task receives
   - **Processing Logic**: Configure the AI processing pipeline
   - **Output Format**: Specify result structure and format

2. **Quality Controls**
   - **Validation Rules**: Automated checks on task results
   - **Confidence Requirements**: Minimum confidence for acceptance
   - **Review Triggers**: Conditions that require human review
   - **Approval Workflows**: Multi-stage approval processes

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Metrics Collection**: Track accuracy, speed, and throughput
   - **Alert Conditions**: Set up notifications for issues
   - **Reporting**: Generate performance and quality reports
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Use metrics to refine processes
