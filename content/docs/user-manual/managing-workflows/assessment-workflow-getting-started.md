## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through creating a complete assessment workflow from start to finish. You'll learn how to set up data sources, configure assessment stages, assign reviewers, and monitor progress.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Access to a Highlighter platform account
- Administrator or workflow creator permissions
- Sample data files to work with
- Basic understanding of your assessment requirements

## Tutorial Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:
- Created a functional assessment workflow
- Configured both machine and human assessment stages
- Set up data routing and quality controls
- Launched your first workflow order
- Monitored workflow performance

## Step 1: Planning Your Workflow

### Define Your Objectives
Before creating the workflow, clearly define:
- **Purpose**: What are you trying to assess or evaluate?
- **Input Data**: What type of data will you be processing?
- **Output Goals**: What decisions or classifications do you need?
- **Quality Standards**: What level of accuracy is required?

### Example Scenario
For this tutorial, we'll create a workflow that:
- Processes uploaded images for quality assessment
- Uses AI to detect potential issues automatically
- Routes questionable images to human reviewers
- Generates final approval/rejection decisions

## Step 2: Creating the Workflow

### Access the Workflow Builder
1. Log into your Highlighter platform
2. Navigate to the "Workflows" section
3. Click "Create New Workflow"
4. Choose "Assessment Workflow" as the template type

### Basic Workflow Configuration
1. **Workflow Name**: "Image Quality Assessment"
2. **Description**: "Automated quality assessment of uploaded images with human review escalation"
3. **Category**: Quality Control
4. **Priority**: Normal

### Data Source Configuration
1. **Input Source**: Select your data source (file upload, database, API)
2. **File Types**: Specify accepted formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
3. **Size Limits**: Set reasonable file size constraints
4. **Validation Rules**: Configure basic data validation

## Step 3: Configuring Assessment Stages

### Stage 1: Data Intake and Validation
1. **Stage Name**: "Data Validation"
2. **Stage Type**: Automated Processing
3. **Functions**:
   - File format verification
   - Size and resolution checks
   - Basic quality metrics
   - Duplicate detection

**Configuration**:
- Set timeout limits for processing
- Configure error handling for invalid files
- Define quality thresholds for automatic rejection

### Stage 2: Machine Assessment
1. **Stage Name**: "AI Quality Analysis"
2. **Stage Type**: Machine Assessment
3. **Agent Selection**: Choose or configure your AI quality assessment agent
4. **Processing Parameters**:
   - Batch size: 10 images
   - Confidence threshold: 85%
   - Processing timeout: 30 seconds per image

**Quality Gates**:
- High confidence (>90%): Auto-approve
- Medium confidence (70-90%): Route to human review
- Low confidence (<70%): Flag for detailed review

### Stage 3: Human Review
1. **Stage Name**: "Expert Review"
2. **Stage Type**: Human Assessment
3. **Review Type**: Classification and Quality Control
4. **Reviewer Assignment**:
   - Assign to "Quality Reviewers" group
   - Set workload distribution to "Even"
   - Configure backup reviewers

**Review Configuration**:
- Review interface: Image annotation tool
- Decision options: Approve, Reject, Request Clarification
- Time limit: 2 minutes per image
- Quality requirements: 95% accuracy

## Step 4: Workflow Logic and Routing

### Decision Points
Configure routing logic between stages:

1. **After Data Validation**:
   - Valid files → AI Quality Analysis
   - Invalid files → Automatic rejection with notification

2. **After AI Assessment**:
   - High confidence approval → Final approval
   - Medium confidence → Human review
   - Low confidence/rejection → Human review with priority flag

3. **After Human Review**:
   - Approved → Final approval
   - Rejected → Final rejection with feedback
   - Clarification needed → Return to previous stage

### Quality Control Measures
- **Audit Sampling**: 10% of auto-approved items undergo human review
- **Consensus Reviews**: Difficult cases reviewed by multiple experts
- **Escalation Rules**: Complex cases escalated to senior reviewers
- **Feedback Loops**: Human decisions used to improve AI performance

## Step 5: Testing Your Workflow

### Validation Testing
1. **Test Data Preparation**:
   - Gather representative sample data (20-30 files)
   - Include edge cases and challenging examples
   - Prepare expected outcomes for comparison

2. **Workflow Testing**:
   - Run test data through the workflow
   - Verify each stage functions correctly
   - Check routing logic and decision points
   - Validate output quality and format

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with larger data volumes
   - Monitor processing times and resource usage
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Verify scalability under load

### User Acceptance Testing
1. **Reviewer Training**:
   - Train human reviewers on new workflow
   - Provide guidelines and examples
   - Conduct practice sessions
   - Address questions and concerns

2. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Gather input from all stakeholders
   - Test user interfaces and tools
   - Identify usability improvements
   - Refine processes based on feedback

## Step 6: Launching Your Workflow

### Deployment Preparation
1. **Final Configuration Review**:
   - Verify all settings and parameters
   - Double-check reviewer assignments
   - Confirm quality thresholds
   - Test notification systems

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guides for reviewers
   - Document workflow processes
   - Prepare troubleshooting guides
   - Set up training materials

### Go-Live Process
1. **Pilot Launch**:
   - Start with limited data volume
   - Monitor closely for issues
   - Make adjustments as needed
   - Gradually increase volume

2. **Full Deployment**:
   - Scale up to production volumes
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Collect user feedback
   - Optimize based on real-world usage

## Step 7: Monitoring and Optimization

### Performance Metrics
Monitor these key indicators:
- **Throughput**: Items processed per hour/day
- **Quality**: Accuracy rates and error percentages
- **Efficiency**: Average processing time per stage
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from reviewers and stakeholders

### Regular Optimization
1. **Weekly Reviews**:
   - Analyze performance metrics
   - Identify bottlenecks or issues
   - Review quality outcomes
   - Collect user feedback

2. **Monthly Optimization**:
   - Adjust thresholds and parameters
   - Retrain AI models with new data
   - Update reviewer assignments
   - Implement process improvements

3. **Quarterly Assessment**:
   - Comprehensive workflow review
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Strategic alignment check
   - Planning for future enhancements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Throughput
