## Overview

Highlighter's similarity detection feature uses advanced computer vision and machine learning to identify objects, patterns, or scenes that are visually similar across video content. This powerful capability enables efficient content analysis, pattern recognition, and automated tagging.

## How Similarity Detection Works

### Core Technology
- **Feature Extraction**: AI extracts visual features from objects and scenes
- **Embedding Generation**: Creates mathematical representations of visual content
- **Similarity Matching**: Compares embeddings to find similar content
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides similarity confidence ratings

### Supported Content Types
- **Objects**: People, vehicles, products, tools, etc.
- **Scenes**: Indoor/outdoor environments, specific locations
- **Patterns**: Textures, shapes, logos, text elements
- **Behaviors**: Movement patterns, activities, interactions

## Setting Up Similarity Detection

### Prerequisites
- Video content uploaded to Highlighter platform
- Appropriate processing permissions
- Clear definition of what you want to find
- Sample reference objects or scenes

### Configuration Steps

1. **Access Similarity Tools**
   - Navigate to the "Analysis" section
   - Select "Similarity Detection"
   - Choose "Find Similar Objects"

2. **Define Search Parameters**
   - **Reference Selection**: Choose reference object or upload sample
   - **Similarity Threshold**: Set minimum similarity score (0.7-0.9 recommended)
   - **Search Scope**: Define which videos or time ranges to search
   - **Object Categories**: Specify types of objects to consider

3. **Advanced Settings**
   - **Temporal Constraints**: Limit search to specific time periods
   - **Spatial Filtering**: Focus on specific regions of the video
   - **Quality Filters**: Exclude low-quality or obscured objects
   - **Duplicate Handling**: Configure how to handle very similar results

## Using the Similarity Search Interface

### Reference Object Selection
1. **From Existing Annotations**:
   - Browse previously annotated objects
   - Select high-quality examples
   - Choose representative instances

2. **Manual Selection**:
   - Use video player to find reference object
   - Draw bounding box around object
   - Confirm selection and quality

3. **Upload Reference Images**:
   - Upload external reference images
   - Ensure high quality and clear visibility
   - Multiple angles improve accuracy

### Search Execution
1. **Launch Search**:
   - Review search parameters
   - Confirm reference selections
   - Start similarity analysis
   - Monitor progress status

2. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Track processing progress
   - View preliminary results
   - Adjust parameters if needed
   - Cancel or modify search if required

## Interpreting Results

### Result Presentation
- **Similarity Scores**: Numerical confidence ratings (0.0-1.0)
- **Visual Comparisons**: Side-by-side reference and match images
- **Temporal Information**: Time stamps and video locations
- **Context Data**: Surrounding scene information

### Quality Assessment
- **High Confidence** (0.9+): Very likely to be correct matches
- **Medium Confidence** (0.7-0.9): Probable matches requiring verification
- **Low Confidence** (<0.7): Possible matches needing expert review

### Result Filtering
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Filter by minimum similarity scores
- **Time Range Filtering**: Focus on specific time periods
- **Quality Filtering**: Exclude poor-quality detections
- **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminate redundant similar matches

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Object Searches
- **Composite Searches**: Find scenes containing multiple similar objects
- **Sequential Patterns**: Detect sequences of similar events
- **Relationship Detection**: Find objects with similar spatial relationships
- **Behavioral Similarity**: Match similar movement or interaction patterns

### Customization Options
- **Sensitivity Tuning**: Adjust detection sensitivity for different use cases
- **Category Weighting**: Emphasize certain object characteristics
- **Temporal Weighting**: Prefer recent or older matches
- **Spatial Priorities**: Focus on specific regions or viewpoints

### Batch Processing
- **Multiple References**: Search for several objects simultaneously
- **Cross-Video Analysis**: Compare objects across different video files
- **Scheduled Searches**: Set up recurring similarity analyses
- **Automated Workflows**: Integrate with assessment workflows

## Use Cases and Applications

### Content Organization
- **Automatic Tagging**: Tag similar objects across large video libraries
- **Content Categorization**: Group videos by similar content types
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and remove redundant content
- **Quality Control**: Find consistent quality issues across content

### Security and Surveillance
- **Person Tracking**: Track individuals across multiple cameras
- **Behavior Analysis**: Identify similar suspicious activities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect recurring security patterns
- **Incident Investigation**: Find related security events

### Marketing and Advertising
- **Brand Recognition**: Find logo and branding appearances
- **Product Placement**: Track product appearances across content
- **Competitor Analysis**: Monitor competitor brand presence
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: Measure branding visibility

### Research and Analysis
- **Behavioral Studies**: Analyze similar behaviors across subjects
- **Pattern Analysis**: Study recurring patterns or phenomena
- **Content Analysis**: Systematic analysis of visual content
- **Trend Identification**: Spot emerging visual trends

## Best Practices

### Reference Selection
- **High Quality**: Use clear, well-lit reference images
- **Representative Examples**: Choose typical instances of the object
- **Multiple Angles**: Include different viewpoints when possible
- **Consistent Lighting**: Consider lighting variations in references

### Search Optimization
- **Appropriate Thresholds**: Balance precision and recall
- **Focused Scope**: Limit search scope to relevant content
- **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust parameters based on initial results
- **Quality Validation**: Manually verify high-value results

### Result Management
- **Systematic Review**: Develop consistent review processes
- **Documentation**: Record search parameters and outcomes
- **Feedback Integration**: Use results to improve future searches
- **Archive Management**: Organize and store important results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Poor Match Quality**
- Adjust similarity thresholds
- Improve reference image quality
- Consider lighting and perspective variations
- Use multiple reference examples

**Too Many False Positives**
- Increase similarity threshold
- Add negative examples
- Refine object categories
- Implement additional filtering

**Missing Expected Matches**
- Lower similarity threshold
- Check reference image quality
- Verify search scope includes relevant content
- Consider temporal or quality filters
