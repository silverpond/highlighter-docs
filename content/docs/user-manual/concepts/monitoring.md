Claims output by the Assessment Workflow is in the form specified by the Taxonomy in Highlighter, and is the data of interest to the organisation. For example:
  * The number of people walking past a camera
  * The number of defects on an asset
  * The amount of tuna in a given location
  * The number of mentions of an organisation in news articles

Where [Evaluation](../evaluation/) aims to provide data about how the claims are generated in the Assessment Workflow, [Monitoring & Reporting](./) aims to provide the data out of the Assessment Workflow itself. The purpose of the evaluation is to identify areas of improvement in the Assessment Workflow itself, and the purpose of monitoring & reporting is to understand the subject under assessment.
