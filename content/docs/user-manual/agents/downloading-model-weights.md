## Overview

When a Training Run completes successfully, it produces various artefacts, including the model weights (checkpoints) and configuration files. These artefacts can be downloaded for local use, deployment, or further analysis.

## Accessing Artefacts

To access the artefacts for a Training Run:

1. In the "Develop" section of the application, navigate to the **Training** page.
2. Select the specific Training Run you are interested in.
3. On the Training Run details page, look for the **Artefacts** panel (usually on the right-hand side).

## Downloading Files

In the **Artefacts** panel, you will see a list of files generated by the training process.

- **Type**: Indicates the type of artefact (e.g., `OnnxOpset11`, `TorchScriptV1`).
- **Download**: If the artefact is available for download, a **Download** button will be visible next to the file type.

Click the **Download** button to save the file to your local machine.

### Availability

Not all artefacts may be downloadable. The availability of the **Download** button is controlled by the system configuration.
