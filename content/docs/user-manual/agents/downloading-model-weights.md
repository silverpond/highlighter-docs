## Overview

When a Training Run completes successfully, it produces various artefacts, including the model weights (checkpoints) and configuration files. These artefacts can be downloaded for local use, deployment, or further analysis.

## Accessing Artefacts

To access the artefacts for a Training Run:

1. In the "Develop" section of the application, navigate to the **Training** page.
2. Select the specific Training Run you are interested in.
3. On the Training Run details page, look for the **Artefacts** panel (usually on the right-hand side).

## Downloading Files

In the **Artefacts** panel, you will see a list of files generated by the training process.

- **Type**: Indicates the type of artefact (e.g., `OnnxOpset11`, `TorchScriptV1`).
- **Download**: If the artefact is available for download, a **Download** button will be visible next to the file type.

Click the **Download** button to save the file to your local machine.

## Finding Training-Run Artefacts Used in an Agent

If you want to download the specific Training-Run Artefacts that are currently being used by a Capability in a Machine Agent, you'll first need to identify which artefacts are linked to that Capability.

### View Capability Details

1. Navigate to the **Assessment Workflow** that contains your Machine Agent.
2. Go to the **Steps** tab and find your **Machine Assessment Step**.
3. Click **Edit** to open the **Agent Designer**.
4. In the Agent Designer, **double-click** on the Capability node you're interested in (or click the hamburger icon next to its title).
5. This will open the Capability details modal showing the Capability's attributes and parameters.

### Locate the Training-Run Artefact ID

In the Capability details modal, you'll see three parameter sections:
- **Frame Parameters**
- **Stream Parameters**
- **Deployment Parameters**

Look in the **Deployment Parameters** section (shown in a JSON editor) for one of the following fields:

- **`training_run_artefact_id`**: The specific ID of the Training-Run Artefact being used
- **`training_run_id`**: The ID of the Training Run (the Capability will use the most recent artefact from this Training Run)

> **Note:** For more information about linking Capabilities to Training-Run Artefacts, see [How To Create and Edit a Machine Agent - Linking a Capability to a Training-Run Artefact](../creating-and-editing-agents/#linking-a-capability-to-a-training-run-artefact).

### Download the Artefact

Once you have the Training-Run Artefact ID or Training Run ID:

1. Navigate to the **Training** page in the "Develop" section.
2. If you have a `training_run_id`, find and select that Training Run.
3. If you have a `training_run_artefact_id`, you'll need to locate the Training Run that contains this artefact (the artefact ID can help you search or filter).
4. Follow the steps in [Accessing Artefacts](#accessing-artefacts) above to download the specific artefact files.
