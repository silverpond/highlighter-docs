## Business Process
A business process is a series of structured, related activities or tasks performed by people or machines to achieve a specific organizational goal. It involves a defined sequence of work steps, which can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.

These processes can be categorized into three different types:

* Management: These are processes that govern the operation of a system. They include strategic management, corporate governance, business process management, and others.

* Operational: These are the core processes that make up the value stream, such as purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, and sales.

* Supporting: These support the core processes and include accounting, recruitment, technical support, and more.

## Assessment Process

An assessment process is sub-process of a broader business process which reviews data coming into an organisation to initiate further downstream tasks.

In the context of a business process, an assessment process could serve multiple functions, including:

* Assessing the condition or performance of physical or intangible assets
* Measuring customer satisfaction or engagement
* Identifying sales opportunities or leads
* Auditing financial performance or compliance with regulations
* Evaluating the performance of employees, departments, or entire business units

Designing an assessment process usually involves several stages, such as defining the assessment criteria, collecting and analyzing relevant data, reporting findings, developing an action plan based on these findings, and regularly reviewing and adjusting the process as necessary.

By integrating assessment processes into broader business processes, organizations can ensure continuous improvement, optimize resource allocation, maintain high standards of quality and compliance, and drive strategic decision-making.



Example Assessment Processes:
* A patient enters Eastern Medical Clinic to work out why he is feeling ill:
    1. He consults a doctor
    2. The doctor orders a blood test
    3. the blood test is analyzed by a specialist who determines that the patient has an iron deficiency

This 3 step process is an assessment process carried out by Eastern Medical Clinic to discover what is wrong with their patients.
