## November 2025

### Enhanced Contributor Workflow Management

**Release Date:** November 19, 2025

We've significantly improved how contributors are assigned and work across different workflow steps, providing a more unified and reliable experience.

#### What's New

Workflow managers can now manage all types of workflow steps using a consistent interface:
- Data source
- Human assessment
- Machine assessment
- Filter

This consolidation makes it easier to manage the setup of workflows without having to learn multiple interfaces.

Also, we've enhanced the technical infrastructure for assigning contributors to workflow steps.

#### Getting Started

To take advantage of these improvements:

1. **Review Your Workflows**: Existing workflows continue to work without changes
2. **Assign Contributors**: Use the enhanced assignment interface for new or existing steps
3. **Learn More**: See our new [Assigning Contributors to Workflow Steps](../../user-manual/managing-workflows/assigning-contributors/) documentation
