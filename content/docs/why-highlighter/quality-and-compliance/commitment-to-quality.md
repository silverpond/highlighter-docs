Silverpond is committed to delivering high-quality solutions and services that consistently meet and exceed client expectations. Our approach to **Quality Management** is holistically integrated within our certified **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** and Highlighter's support of the **Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)** framework.

Rather than pursuing **ISO 9001**, we’ve built a system grounded in **ISO 27001** and **ISO 42001** that delivers the same principles:

- Consistency  
- Reliability  
- Risk management  
- Continual improvement  

This system is composed of two key pillars:

### ISO/IEC 27001 Certified ISMS  
Our ISMS provides the foundational governance and process controls for our entire operation, ensuring the security, integrity, and availability of our products and client data. This certification demonstrates our commitment to rigorous, audited operational standards.

### Highlighter as an AI Management System (AIMS)  
For our AI-specific services and the Highlighter platform, we operationalize the principles of the **ISO/IEC 42001** standard. This ensures our AI development and deployment processes are transparent, accountable, and focused on delivering high-quality, responsible outcomes.
