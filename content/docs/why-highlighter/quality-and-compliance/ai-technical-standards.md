Silverpond's Highlighter platform is in alignment with the Australian Government's AI Technical Standards, positioning it as the Enterprise Perception System for government agencies seeking compliant AI deployment.

# Comprehensive Lifecycle Management
Highlighter operates as the world's only Enterprise Perception System (EPS), providing a centralized platform that merges human expertise and AI capabilities to analyze data from various sources and take appropriate actions. This comprehensive approach directly supports the Australian Government's AI lifecycle requirements across all steps from discovery to retirement.

## Whole of AI Lifecycle Compliance:

* Statement 1 (Operational Model): Our Services Methodology encompasses complete ML solution delivery with clear definitions of success, accuracy expectations, and feedback mechanisms
* Statement 3 (People Capabilities): Highlighter enables decentralized workflows empowering human and AI agents to collaborate, with comprehensive staff training and capability development through our SDK
* Statement 4 (AI Auditing): The platform provides end-to-end auditability with comprehensive documentation across the AI system lifecycle, ensuring traceability of decisions from requirements through to operational impacts

# Quality Management and Information Security Framework
Silverpond is committed to delivering high-quality solutions through our certified Information Security Management System (ISMS) grounded in ISO 27001 and alignment with ISO 42001. This approach directly addresses the Australian Government's requirements for:
