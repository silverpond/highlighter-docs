Highlighter is the world’s only fully integrated Enterprise Perception System (EPS)—a platform that brings together human expertise and AI capabilities to collect, analyze, and act on data from diverse sources. While open-source tools and other commercial solutions can address fragments of this process, Highlighter offers a unified, end-to-end approach that simplifies development, accelerates results, and ensures consistent, enterprise-grade performance. Learn more about what an Enterprise Perception System is in our [Concepts section](/docs/concepts/introduction).

## A Complete Perception Lifecycle in One Platform

Many data-processing and AI solutions tackle only a narrow piece of the perception pipeline—such as data ingestion, model training, or reporting. Others may provide analytics insights but stop short of enabling automated or structured decision-making and action. Highlighter, on the other hand, brings every stage of the perception process under one platform, ensuring you can seamlessly transform raw data into informed actions:

1.	Data Collection -- Rapidly gather information from sensors, IoT devices, cameras, and more—so you can capture every relevant signal your enterprise needs.
2.	Schema -- Organize and structure data through a standardized taxonomy. This foundation ensures that human and AI agents alike can interpret, compare, and act on the information effectively.
3.	Assessment -- Leverage both domain experts and AI models within a unified workflow. By standardizing processes, your team gains repeatable, reliable ways to turn raw data into actionable insights.
4.	Decide -- Configure your organization’s decision logic—whether automated via AI rules or controlled by human approvals—to ensure consistent, data-driven judgments.
5.	Actions -- Close the loop by automating or coordinating real-world tasks, whether they are physical processes in a factory or digital actions in your IT systems. Highlighter ensures you never get stuck at the “analysis” stage.
6.	Agent Development & Deployment -- Train and deploy specialized ML models or human-managed processes within the same ecosystem. This accelerates iteration and reduces the overhead of juggling separate tools for different use cases.
7.	Evaluation -- Continuously monitor the accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of each agent and action step. This feedback loop enables proactive improvements and ensures your enterprise stays ahead of evolving demands.
8.	Visualization -- Transform data into intuitive dashboards, charts, and maps that clarify trends and patterns—making it easy for stakeholders at all levels to understand and act on critical insights.


By integrating these components, Highlighter offers a truly end-to-end solution. You move beyond basic analytics or standalone AI modules and establish a single platform that drives cohesive workflows, data-driven decisions, and tangible actions throughout your entire organization.

## Flexibility and Control for Your Enterprise

One of Highlighter’s core strengths is its ability to adapt to the unique needs and structures of each organization. While some platforms force you to conform to rigid workflows or service models, Highlighter puts you firmly in the driver’s seat. Here’s how:
* Configurable Workflows
Highlighter lets you design and tailor workflows—from data collection to decision-making and automated actions—to match your existing business processes. Because every enterprise has its own structure and terminology, you decide the best way to integrate Highlighter’s capabilities into your day-to-day operations.
* Agent Customization
Whether you need human-driven tasks, fully automated AI models, or a combination of both, Highlighter supports a wide range of agent types. You’re free to build, deploy, or refine agents for any workflow you see fit—without being locked into a one-size-fits-all approach.
* Scalable Deployment
As your data volumes and use cases grow, Highlighter can scale accordingly. Deploy additional agents, integrate more data sources, or roll out new workflows to different departments on your own timeline, ensuring the platform evolves alongside your organization.
* Modular Integrations
Highlighter is built to work seamlessly within your existing technology stack. Its open architecture and APIs make it easy to integrate with popular data pipelines, cloud services, and enterprise systems—giving you the freedom to leverage your current investments without extensive re-engineering.
* Role-Based Access and Security
Enterprises often manage complex permission structures and regulatory requirements. Highlighter’s robust access controls and security features mean you can set up detailed rules for who can view, edit, or act on data, ensuring compliance and data integrity at all levels.

Many open-source libraries and smaller-scale AI products lack the collaboration and governance features essential for enterprise operations. Highlighter is designed for large teams, complex security requirements, and mission-critical use cases. Role-based access control, standardized workflows, and a maturity model spanning from ad-hoc (Level 0) to fully optimized (Level 3) enable your organization to scale perception solutions effectively and maintain consistency across departments.

## Rapid Time-to-Value

Building your own perception system from scratch requires significant engineering, from data pipelines to machine learning infrastructure, labeling tools, and orchestration. Highlighter dramatically shortens this timeline:
*   Ready-to-Use Modules: Out-of-the-box components for labeling, training, deployment, and performance tracking.
*   Machine-Assisted Labeling: Accelerate labeling efforts by automatically suggesting annotations, saving time and effort.
*   Iterative Training Loops: Continuously refine models by incorporating real-world feedback and Business-As-Usual (BAU) data.
*   Proven Engagement Process: Our structured workshops and planning sessions help you define success metrics, roadmap milestones, and alignment with business objectives.
* Ongoing Optimization
With Highlighter, you don’t just get a static solution. You gain a platform designed for continuous improvement. Monitor agent performance, retrain models, and adjust workflows—all within a single interface—so you can respond rapidly to new opportunities and evolving challenges.

This streamlined approach allows you to realize ROI faster than by assembling and maintaining multiple open-source or third-party tools.

## Expert Services and Support

Choosing Highlighter means you also gain access to our experienced team, who guide you through every phase of your project:
*   Success Criteria Definition: We help you determine realistic accuracy goals and clarify your “definition of done.”
*   Realistic Project Planning: Understand data requirements, timelines, and resources before you begin.
*   Continuous Education: Access training materials and workshops covering essential ML topics, ensuring widespread adoption within your organization.
*   Co-Development and Self-Service: Build capabilities with our SDK, leverage best practices from our team, or let us handle model training and deployment on your behalf.

By working alongside our expert consultants, you minimize risk, speed development, and gain confidence in your solution’s long-term viability.

## Reduced Complexity and Ongoing Innovation

Piecing together multiple open-source libraries or point solutions can create data silos, inconsistent workflows, and complicated security configurations. Highlighter avoids these pitfalls by offering a comprehensive, well-integrated system:
* Unified Data Management: Prevents fragmentation and maintains a single source of truth.
* Consistent Standards: Ensures consistent taxonomy, labeling, and reporting across teams.
* Security and Compliance: Centralizing your perception system within Highlighter makes it simpler to enforce policies, manage access, and meet regulatory requirements.

Because the platform is continuously evolving, you can also adopt new data sources, incorporate advanced AI models, and adjust workflows as your organization’s needs change—without having to rebuild your technology stack from scratch.
