# Highlighter Public Documentation

This repo contains public documentation for Silverpond's Highlighter product.

See /content folder for details.

This documentation site uses Zola to generate a static website. Follow their [installation page](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) to install Zola and get started. For ease of use, there's a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) for common Zola actions.

Or you can use flakes (eg., `nix develop` or direnv (.envrc) to install Zola and setup the environment.

# Documentation Style

This documentation site follows the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) method of documentation:
  * Concepts (for explanation and learning)
  * Getting Started and Tutorials sections (to be developed)
  * How-To Guide section (to be developed)
  * Reference (to be developed)

The static website is deployed via [Netlify](https://netlify.app/), following Zola's [instructions](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/netlify/):
